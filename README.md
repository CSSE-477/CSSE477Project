The project is a web server that can handle GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, and POST requests. The web server, at the moment, does not handle any other requests. 

The project can be run by downloading the jar and running `java -jar YoloSwagSws-1.0.x.jar`. We have devoted two of our assigned VMs to be staging (19) and production (06) servers. You can visit 477-19.csse.rose-hulman.edu/YoloSwagSWS/ or 477-06.csse.rose-hulman.edu/YoloSwagSWS/ to verify.
