The project is a web server that can handle GET requests. The web server, at the moment, does not handle POST, PUT, DELETE, or HEAD requests. 

The project can be run by downloading the jar and running `java -jar YoloSwagSws-1.0.x.jar`. We have devoted two of our assigned VMs to be staging(19) and production(06) servers. You can visit 477-19.csse.rose-hulman.edu/YoloSwagSWS/ or 477-09.csse.rose-hulman.edu/YoloSwagSWS/ to verify.
